# BluciferBNB - Application for Vacation Rentals Around Denver

## Pair project by Caleb Haizlett and Kim McCaskill during Module 3 at Turing School of Software and Design

### Learning Goals:

- Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
- Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
- Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
- Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
- Become familiar with promises, nested fetch requests, and handling the UI based on acceptance of data.
- Become familiar with routing and how to handle dynamic routes.
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
- Write tests for React components and some asynchronous functionality.

### Overview of Site:
- We utilize an external API that houses data about different areas of Denver and associated rentals available in the those areas.
- The user has ability to: 
  - Log in
  - Search through different areas with descriptions
  - Check listings in each area with details of each listing

## Setup

Fork then clone down this repository. 

Then install the library dependencies. Run:

```
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with some `h1` text and a pink background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.


## How to View Your Code in Action

In the terminal, run:

```
npm start
```

Browser should open up with localhost:3000


## Running Tests

```
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.
